So once, I have managed to develop fully the chat system then I'll proceeed to develop the OAuth2 system then everything will become clear and easy to understand to me so then I'll try my best till I break through the fundamental concepts of the web development
I want to proceed to develop fullStack Web Applications when I began to master each concept my next move would be about being keen on the backEnd and become able to learn nestJs + angularJs
then I'll move into deepen my understanding on the AWS cloud practioner fundamentals then I'll move into studying AWS cloud solution artitechure then I'll be able to build E2E with ease.
So God please be with me till I master these concepts and become able to develop full systems with all my skills and energy.
